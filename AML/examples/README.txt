The graphics here are provided to develop and test AML with an actual graphic set.
We just choosed the sprite lib because it looks nice ;)
A big THANK YOU ! for the people who made it, that will save us a big amount of time creating graphics, mainly for test purpose.

Please read the license.txt file. It contains all that you have to know if you want to use it.
Any problem or question, dont hesitate to mail me : asmodehn@gna.org

A set of graphic for test will probably be made for AML under a full BSD-compatible license later... whenever somebody wants to do it :)
