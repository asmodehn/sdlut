SDLut Tests Organization
========================

Thumb rules
-----------

- Test should be automatic, as much as possible
- All proper test should be run with "ctest" to spot problems easily
- Tests should match API organization.
- No test will be made on *::internal namespace, as the classes there shouldnt be accessed by the user.
- a test return exit status of 0 in case of success. If any error occurs, a different exist status should be returned, and a proper error message displayed
- one test file per tested class, with parameters depending on test phase

Exhaustive list of tests
========================

- TestRect : Test Rect arithmetics
- TestColor : Test Color values, display and alpha blending
- TestImage : Test Image loading
- TestScreenBuffer : Test different display options
- PerfRefresh : Performance testing of displaying sprites on screen
- PerfRefreshAlpha : Performance testing of displaying sprites on screen, with alpha blending.

TODO : more test when the API gets more stabilized...
