This is the source repository for the Rage project, a still new cross-platform game / simulation engine.

While there are still a lot of changes happening, and the interface is not stable yet, you might want to try it, but we dont provide any warranty on what could happen afterwards ^^.
Like if while playing with the engine and coding your game you are so surprised that your coffee jump out your mug and fall into the keyboard, we decline any responsibilities on this :p

Other than that those files might be of interest for you :

BUILDING.txt : everything you need to know to build the existing Rage parts

CODING.txt : a reference for developer about good coding practices, and some rules to follow, so everybody is likely to understand your code without spending hours on one line

LICENSE.txt : the license and what you can and cannot do with this software.

Enjoy!
