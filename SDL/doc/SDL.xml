  <title>RAGE::SDL : The C++ wrapper for SDL</title>

  <section>
    <title>Features</title>

    <para>This library is mostly a C++ portable layer over the <ulink
    url="http://www.libsdl.org">Smart DirectMedia Library</ulink>. The aim is
    to have a C++ interface to SDL. Users should be able to use it simply and
    have at least a "default consistent behaviour".</para>

    <para>AS soon as the wrapping of SDL is complete, we will start looking at
    wrapping all the SDL "Standard Libs" in the same way.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Graphic Interface</title>

      <para>The graphic interface is a pure virtual class called "Engine". you
      need to derivate it with you own if you want to be able to display
      something in your SDL window. You can use either OpenGL functions or
      RAGE::SDL 2D functions, providing you created the Window with the
      correct settings.</para>

      <para>If you are using 2D functions you might want to the Video
      Interface inside the Engine.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Input Interface</title>

      <para>The input interface is made by EventManager, Joystick, Keyboard,
      Mouse. You will probably need to extend them to implement the behaviour
      you want.</para>

      <title>Video Interface</title>

      <para>The video Interface is made by RGBSurface, VideoSurface and
      GLSurface mostly.</para>

      <title>Common Core Components</title>

      <para>This is a list of usefull features added only for the need of this
      C++ wrapper. But still they might be usefull somewhere else, and are not
      really related to the main subject fo the C++ wrapper</para>

      <section>
        <title>Logger</title>

        <para>The Logger class is the only feature that was needed so
        far.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Code::Blocks build</title>

      <para>I am personnaly using CodeBlocks on windows with mingw to build
      RAGE::SDL. However it misses a dependency checking for the libraries
      needed. At the moment it is not a big problem as only SDL is needed. But
      while we will add more dependencies CMake will be used to have a
      consistent way of building RAGE::SDL.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Makefile build</title>

      <para><emphasis>Makefiles can be generated from Cmake for most of the
      unix platforms. Not tested yet.</emphasis></para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>CMake build</title>

      <para>If you dont use either Codeblocks, or make files, and want to be
      able to build RAGE::SDL using your own favorite environment, try the
      CMake build. It generates files for most of the compilers / build
      system.</para>

      <para>The good thing with CMake is that it will check the dependencies
      available on your system and help you to configure your system for
      development.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Testing RAGE::SDL</title>

      <para>There are a few test that are usefull to test the C++ wrapper.
      most of them are still the old SDL tests, not yet using the wrapper...
      lots of work to do.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Installing RAGE::SDL</title>

      <para>RAGE::SDL will be built as a dynamic library or a static library.
      Right now only the static library is built</para>
